# JSnap---Screenshot-capture-in-Java

JSnap is a Java application that allows you to capture as many screenshots you like and save them all together
or choose to keep the ones you like.

It allows you to rename them and choose the destination folder in which the application will save them.

The application uses the [jNativeHook](https://github.com/kwhat/jnativehook) library for global keystrokes, capturing screenshots with the PRINTSCREEN key.

The .jar executable of the application can be found in the 'dist' directory.
